public

    presently Using ../public/grid.css for Grid Layout, was using reactstrap - a bootstrap module, but project size became larger and code structure not to cool. Some other pages still using reactstap, if you feel you like it, you can leave it. 

    ../public/grid.css - xs,sm,md,lg,xlg

    animate.css for quick css animations.

App Components

    - Navbar 
        *check ./pages/Delivery for exmaple with bgcolor
        *check ./pages/Home/header for exmaple without bgcolor

    - Footer
        *check ./pages/Home for exmaple 

    - Button - Some pages still need to implement this in replace of the default button - check ./pages/Home/component/header for example.

    - Input - Some pages still need to implement this in replace of the default input - check ./pages/Delivery/component/info/parcel for example.
